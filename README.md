# AUTOMATED-HOME-FINANCING
This project is focused on finding an elaborate decision policy for the Customer Service Representative (CSR) department of a Home Financing company, which can be adopted by the CSR in the CSR-customer interactions and will result in maximum profit for the company. The company under study in this project is Dream Home Financing, it offers loan packages to customers who are looking for loans in order to buy, build or repair their homes. The analyst will use old data from company’s database and determine whether the CSR-customer interaction will be successful or not, and then they will define a policy based on the values and probabilities of uncertain variables which are associated with the calculation of revenue generated by the company over the loan term and it’s Net Present Value (NPV). The values of these uncertain variables may change from customer to customer but in order to define a decision policy, they are modelled into probability distribution using historical data from previous CSR-customer interactions.
